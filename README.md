Linked Lists and Stacks
In the linked list class add the following:
a reverseprint() function that prints the linked list in the reverse direction
an enqueue() function that adds a new node to the tail of the linked list
a dequeue() function that removes a node from the head of the list and returns the data stored in the removed node.
Write a new check() function that checks for correctly nested brackets of four types: (), [], {}, and <>
It should return 1 for any correctly nested string of brackets: (), (()()), ([]<>){}, {(<[][]>)}{()}, etc. 
It should return 0 for any incorrectly nested string of brackets: (], ([)], [{<(, (()]()), etc.
